### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a Front-End Developer focused on building responsive, accessible, and user-centric interfaces that solve real-world problems.  
With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I combine **pixel-perfect UI design** with **efficient, maintainable code**.

I take pride in transforming complex ideas into interactive, intuitive web experiences.  
Currently expanding into full-stack development while keeping UX and performance at the core of everything I build.
